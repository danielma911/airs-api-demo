    "# User Guide: Embedding Security Checks in LLM Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates how to integrate a **security-checking tool** into an LLM (Large Language Model) workflow. The goal is to validate user inputs and LLM-generated responses for security compliance using ***Palo Alto Network AI Runtime Security API Intercept***.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Palo Alto Network AI Runtime Security API Intercept*** is a threat detection service designed to secure AI applications. It helps discover and protect applications using REST APIs by embedding Security-as-Code directly into source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scan API service scans prompts and models responses to identify potential threats and provides actionable recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The APIs protect your AI models, applications, and datasets by programmatically scanning prompts and models for threats, enabling robust protection across public and private models with model-agnostic functionality. Its model-agnostic design ensures seamless integration with any AI model, regardless of its architecture or framework. This enables consistent security across diverse AI models without any model-specific customization.\n",
    "You can use this API in your application to send prompts or model responses and receive a threat assessment, along with the recommended actions based on your AI security profile.\n",
    "For information on using the APIs, see the [API Intercept API Reference](https://pan.dev/ai-runtime-security/scan/api) Documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Benefits:\n",
    "- Simple integration: Secure AI application models and datasets from insecure model outputs, prompt injections, and sensitive data loss.\n",
    "- Comprehensive threat detection: Provides extensive app, model, and data threat detection while maintaining ease of use.\n",
    "- Exceptional flexibility and defense: Integrates API-based threat detection to deliver unmatched adaptability and layered protection.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "- Introduce a security-checking tool to validate prompts and responses.\n",
    "- Demonstrate how to handle blocked inputs and responses based on the security verdict.\n",
    "- Build a flexible agent workflow that incorporates security checks.\n",

    "# Congratulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you've successfully built a secure and robust AI-powered system that emphasizes the importance of **safety and compliance** in LLM interactions. Here's what you've achieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integrated the AIRS API Intercept**:\n",
    "   - Implemented a security-checking function to validate user prompts and LLM-generated responses.\n",
    "   - Leveraged the AIRS API to detect and block unsafe or malicious content dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Built a Secure Agent Workflow**:\n",
    "   - Ensured that all inputs and outputs are intercepted for security validation before being processed or delivered.\n",
    "   - Designed the system to gracefully handle blocked requests with informative feedback, ensuring transparency and compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Usability with Versatility**:\n",
    "   - Combined security validation with additional tools, such as web content extraction, to provide a flexible and secure user experience.\n",
    "   - Developed retry mechanisms and fallback logic to ensure robustness in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Value of AIRS API Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating the AIRS API intercept, you've demonstrated how to:\n",
    "- Enhance trust in AI systems by preventing the misuse of LLMs for generating or processing unsafe content.\n",
    "- Build AI workflows that prioritize safety, making them suitable for enterprise and high-stakes applications.\n",
    "- Strike a balance between functionality and security by enabling advanced features (like web scraping) while adhering to strict security policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this lab, you've gained hands-on experience in designing AI systems that are not only intelligent but also **secure, responsible, and aligned with industry best practices**. Excellent work! 🚀"
